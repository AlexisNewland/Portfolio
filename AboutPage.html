		Here at Alexis' Kitchen, we cut the BS. We like our recipes being straight to the point. There is no need to scroll through my life story, my conspiracy theories, or what have you, to get to my recipe. That is why, (if you care) I will just attach the mission and background statement here about Alexis' Kitchen. Happy Feasting!<br /> <br />
                Up until 2023, the Raymond Family’s “Coat of Arms Family Favorites” recipe book was just a physical copy. While
                it is still important to carry a physical copy of this beloved family heirloom, in 2023, it is super convenient
                to digitize information.<br /><br />With that being said, I ultimately decided that it was time to take our
                family favorite recipes and put them on a website where the family can conveniently view the recipes and also be
                shared with others.<br /><br />Let me let you in on some family history:<br /><br />This recipe book was put
                together by the Raymonds, being my great great grandparents. Below is the excerpt of family history found in the
                beginning of the recipe book.<br /><br />“Ross Lee Raymond&#39;s grandfather, Ebenezer Raymond, was born in New
                York State and ran a tug boat on the Erie Canal. After he married Sarah Burnham, a native of England, they
                farmed near Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, where Ross&#39;s father, Albert F. Raymond, was born. When Albert was 17
                years old they moved to a farm near Cedar Falls. Albert married Susan Smith and they lived on Ebenezer&#39;s
                farm.<br /><br />In 1892 Albert moved with his wife and 7 children, Effie, Ross, Myrtie, Fannie, Fred, Wayne,
                and Roilla to a farm 2 1/2 miles East of Sanborn, IA and homesteaded 320 acres. Twelve years later it was
                reduced to 240 acres.<br />Ross took over management in 1903 and married Amy Effie Hakeman on December 21,
                1904.<br /><br />Amy&#39;s father, George Hakeman, was born in Lincolnshire, England and came to this country as
                a young man. On his 21st birthday he enlisted in the army, fought in the Civil War, and took part in the siege
                of Vicksburg. During one of the battles George was forced to leave his fatally wounded brother, James, behind.
                He was discharged after 3 years because of illness.<br /><br />Ross and Amy raised 8 children; Merton (born
                April 23, 1906), Faye (March 13, 1908), Lee (November 18, 1910), Fern (February 25, 1913), Ruth (March 27,
                1917), Joyce (June 4, 1920), Jay (April 6, 1925), and Harriett (August 15, 1927). <br /><br />Merton married
                Ferne Houser - 4 children - Harlyn, Gayle, Dean and Sherryl.<br /><br />Faye married Ed Huibregtse - 2 children
                - Ray and Allene. <br /><br />Lee married Wilma De Young - 3 children - Wayne, David, and Judy.<br /><br />Fern
                married Carlyle Rensberger - 1 son - Mike.<br /><br />Ruth married Russ Glazier - 4 children - Linda, Andrea,<br />Melanie,
                and Mark.<br /><br />Joyce married Willis Petrich - 5 children - Ward, Bruce, Scott, Jan, and Meg.<br /><br />Jay
                married Dorris Wright - 5 children - Ace, Roccy, Todd, Rex, and Anne.<br /><br />Harriett married Kenneth Warnke
                - 4 boys - Matthew, Kirk, Phil, and Bret.<br /><br />All 8 children attended the same rural school and all
                graduated from Sanborn High School, as had their father, Ross, in 1902 and mother, Amy, in 1904. Twenty-one
                grandchildren also graduated from Sanborn High School.<br />Ross and Amy lived on the same farm until they
                retired and moved into their new home in Sanborn in 1958. Ross passed away in 1964 at 82 years. Amy passed away
                in 1976 at 90 years. They have approximately 200 living descendants at the time of this writing.”<br /><br />Of
                the eight children, Ruth was my great grandmother and her daughter Linda is my grandma. I am converting
                this recipe book to online in honor of my great grandma Ruth and grandma Linda.
